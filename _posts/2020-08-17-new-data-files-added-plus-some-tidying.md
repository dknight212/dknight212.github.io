title:  New data files added plus some tidying
---
 
I've played around with the new Shiny website ([https://trafficflows.shinyapps.io/Traffic/](https://trafficflows.shinyapps.io/Traffic/)) and added some new data for Burntwood Lane (two sites from May 2018) and Tranmere Road (two sites from March 2018).

  

I've got a lot more I want to do with the visuals but I keep getting distracted with other things! For now I've had to be satisfied with some tidying up of dates and some formatting.
