title: Back again

I've decided to start this blog running again. I'm still using Jekyll to run this, and it didn't take very long to set it back running, which was nice. Let's see how it goes.

The last post in the blog talks about just starting using Obsidian. I suspect the very first proper post I'll do in this version will be about how I've got on with Obsidian over the past few years. Obviously, as you can tell, I'm still using it.
